# tubearchivist subscription listener

so in tubearchist the "schedule" feature is not working at all (literally out of nowhere, i haven't modified any settings. no logs.)

this tool uses the youtube data api to check every channel for new videos. if there is any new videos, it will tell tubearchivist to rescan subscriptions.

i also saw that the tubearchivist project paywalled real time channel notifications. i make feature free.

## why cant you just fix the bug in tubearchivist?

not a fan of the codebase 
this is somehow easier
